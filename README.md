\
Welcome to Vetle's repository for Homework 03 in STAT545 - Exploratory Data Analysis. This repository is probably only of interest to you if you are either of the following:\
(a) a TA or fellow student responsible for grading my work or\
(b) a prospective future student, wondering what we learn in this course\
If you are not one of the above and **still** would like to check out this repo, please, be my guest. Enjoy!\

For people grading my work, please look at the md-file, as the Rmd-file does not include the plots.\
